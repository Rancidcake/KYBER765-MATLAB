Kyber-MATLAB
This project provides MATLAB and Simulink bindings for the Kyber768 post-quantum KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism).
It wraps the reference C implementation of Kyber into MATLAB using MEX files, and includes a simple smoke test and example GUI hooks.

Requirements
Windows 10/11 (x64)
MATLAB R2025a (or later) with:
MATLAB Coder
Simulink (optional, if you want Simulink integration)
Microsoft Visual Studio with MSVC compiler
Community Edition is fine. Install Desktop Development with C++ workload.
MATLAB must detect cl.exe as the C++ compiler (mex -setup C++).
Build Instructions (Windows)
Open MATLAB.
Set up the compiler (one-time):
mex -setup C++
Select Microsoft Visual C++.
Move into the MATLAB folder:
cd('path\to\kyber-matlab\matlab')
Run the build script:
build_mex
This will compile three MEX files:
kyber768_keygen_mex.mexw64
kyber768_encaps_mex.mexw64
kyber768_decaps_mex.mexw64
⚠️ Note: On Windows, the extension will be .mexw64.
Smoke Test
After building, run:
demo_smoke_test
Expected output:
Keygen...
Encaps...
Decaps...
OK! Shared secret match. ss = <hex string>
Using in MATLAB
High-level MATLAB wrappers:
kyber768_keygen.m → generates key pair
kyber768_encaps.m → encapsulates shared secret
kyber768_decaps.m → decapsulates shared secret
Example:
[pk, sk] = kyber768_keygen();
[ct, ss_enc] = kyber768_encaps(pk);
ss_dec = kyber768_decaps(ct, sk);

isequal(ss_enc, ss_dec)   % should be true
Simulink Integration
Use a MATLAB Function block in Simulink.
Inside the block, call the wrappers above.
Example function body:
function out = demoKyber(~)
  [pk, sk] = kyber768_keygen();
  [ct, ss1] = kyber768_encaps(pk);
  ss2 = kyber768_decaps(ct, sk);
  out = isequal(ss1, ss2);
end
This outputs a boolean true if the KEM round-trip succeeds.
Known Issues / Notes
Do not build files in external/kyber/nistkat or external/kyber/test → those are only for NIST KAT harnesses and require OpenSSL. The MEX build only needs the core C sources.
Warnings like “treating .c as C++” are harmless.
For GUI demos, see mini_gui.m (optional).
Quick Troubleshooting (Windows)
Error: cl.exe not found
→ Install Visual Studio with Desktop C++ workload and restart MATLAB.
Error: Undefined symbol crypto_kem_*
→ Ensure you compiled with all core Kyber .c files (see build_mex.m).
Error: _mexFunction missing
→ Add -R2018a in the build flags (MATLAB R2025a uses the modern C++ MEX API).
Final Word
This setup has been validated on macOS (Sequoia) + MATLAB R2025a and is portable to Windows 11 + MATLAB R2025a with MSVC. Once built, the API behaves the same across platforms
